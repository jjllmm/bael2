# Hermine periodically publishes the thoughts and reflexions of authors from different backgrounds, but that all have in common to approach intimately and in a transversal ways, things they consider to be central in our lives.

What now? What next? Interrogations are often expressed only after a long process of maturation. They are altered by many layers of sanitization and end up being polished to the extent of losing their potential of transformation. Let us be allowed to be vulnerable in our thoughts, to trigger in everyone's reflexion some natural and organic resets.
