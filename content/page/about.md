# Hermine periodically publishes the thoughts and reflexions of authors from different backgrounds, but that all have in common to approach intimately and in a transversal ways, things they consider to be central.

What now? What next? Interrogations are often expressed only after a long process of maturation. They are altered by many layers of sanitization and end up being polished to the extent of preventing anyone from branching out midway, thus eliminating any potential of transformation. Let us be allowed to be vulnerable in our thoughts, to trigger in everyone's reflexion some natural and organic developments, hoepfully resulting in many of our thoughts resets. Hermine's proposal is to put side by side different minds in the making, and their connections.
